Decided to operate on lines of strings (`string[]`) since strings behave like arrays in JS. 

It could make sense to add line of dots above, below left and right of input to always get `.` and not
have to coalesce `.` and undefined when going out of bounds, but I did every access in one function `getXY...` 
and handled the borders there.


type PartNumber = {
  part: string;
  line: number;
  start: number;
  end: number;
};

`String.matchAll` was big help in finding ranges of numbers to check.
